# ntc-netbox-plugin-nautobot-ansible

A plugin for [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).

## Installation

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip
```shell
pip install ntc-netbox-plugin-nautobot-ansible
```

> The plugin is compatible with NetBox 2.8.3 and higher
 
To ensure NetBox Nautobot Ansible Tower integration is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the NetBox root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `ntc-netbox-plugin-nautobot-ansible` package:

```no-highlight
# echo ntc-netbox-plugin-nautobot-ansible >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `configuration.py`:

```python
# In your configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["netbox_nautobot", "netbox_nautobot_ansible"]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
  "netbox_nautobot": {
    # ...
  },
  "netbox_nautobot_ansible": {
    # ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
  }
}
```

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings

- `tower_uri`: Ansible Tower HTTP URI
- `tower_username`: Ansible Tower username
- `tower_password`: Ansible Tower password

## Usage

### API

TODO

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of NetBox through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:
- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. 

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--netbox-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and NetBox to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`
